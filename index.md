## Vanagandr Blog

I had a game programmed - a two player turn based strategy game - and was interested in an AI opponent. This lead me to investigate Neurel Networks, then Convolutional Neural Networks, and I was searching for information on how Residual Neural Networks function. I came across a [You-Tube video "Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Full Course from fast.ai and Jeremy Howard"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oyCUWLL_fU&list=PLWKjhJtqVAblStefaz_YOVpDWqcRScc2s&index=7).

I had some issues in understanding where all the information was available at first, but worked through that. The [course website](https://course.fast.ai/) also has videos for each lesson. These videos are also available on You-Tube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SF_h3xF3cE&list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSvpQjSnJJ_PmDQB_VyT5iU).

The [entire book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) is available online. I am currently working through the chapters.
